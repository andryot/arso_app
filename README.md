# Unofficial ARSO weather app

Unofficial ARSO weather app was created for as a university project for mobile development. The project was much inspired by the already existing (blue) ARSO weather application which can be found under (https://vreme.arso.gov.si/). The existing official ARSO website enables a PWA mobile application or shortcut to be installed on mobile devices. However that solution is quite slow and we wanted to create a faster native experience for android and iOS. The current application in its development stage has somewhat limited features compared to the official ARSO application.
